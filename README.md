FaxPixel is a project I am currently working on to help simplify 2D graphics for the terminal/command prompt.
FaxPixel was built with the Clang compiler with Replit, although all the code can be used universally with mainly the Visual C++ compiler, MinGW compiler, and the Clang compiler. 

If you wish to run the code now, you can.

The library has four main files:
1. "fax.cpp"
2. "fax.hpp"
3. "pixel.cpp"
4. "pixel.hpp"

You only need to include fax.hpp and pixel.hpp in your code.
The other two files with this library ("main.cpp" and "color.fax"), are only there for example.

Project Status: FaxPixel is currently still being worked on, but can be used.
