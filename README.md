# FaxPixel
A Basic 2D "Graphics Library" For The Terminal (Linux)

FaxPixel is a project I am currently working on to help simplify 2D graphics for the Terminal.
FaxPixel was built with the Clang compiler with Repl.it, although all the code can be used universally with mainly the MinGW compiler, and the Clang compiler. 

If you wish to run the code now, you can.

The library has six main files (excluding the bitmap library included in the FaxPixel library):
1. "fax.cpp"
2. "fax.hpp"
3. "pixel.cpp"
4. "pixel.hpp"
5. "convert.cpp"
6. "convert.hpp"

You only need to include fax.hpp, pixel.hpp, and convert.hpp in your code.
The other two files with this library ("main.cpp" and "color.fax"), are only there for example.
Also please put the fax.cpp, pixel.cpp, and convert.cpp files in the same directory as fax.hpp, pixel.hpp, and convert.hpp.

Project Status: FaxPixel is currently still being worked on, but can be used.
