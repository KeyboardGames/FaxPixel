# FaxPixel
A Basic 2D "Graphics Library" For The Terminal/Command Prompt

FaxPixel is a project I am currently working on to help simplify 2D graphics for the terminal/command prompt.
FaxPixel was built with the Clang compiler with Replit, although all the code can be used universally with mainly the Visual C++ compiler, MinGW compiler, and the Clang compiler. 

If you wish to run the code now, you can.

The library has four main files:
1. "fax.cpp"
2. "fax.hpp"
3. "pixel.cpp"
4. "pixel.hpp"

You only need to include fax.hpp and pixel.hpp in your code.
The other two files with this library ("main.cpp" and "color.fax"), are only there for example.
Also please put the fax.cpp and pixel.cpp files in the same directory as fax.hpp and pixel.hpp.

Project Status: FaxPixel is currently still being worked on, but can be used. Soon, there will be a tool that will make creating a .fax file easier.
