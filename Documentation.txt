Code:

To use the library, please include:
#include "pixel.hpp"
#include "fax.hpp"

After that, call FaxRead("PATH/TO/FAXFILE");
This will read and output the data from the ".fax" file*



Fax File*:

The Fax File is a file in which the data for what color of pixel, and where a pixel shall be is in.
The data in these files is inputted by you........ for now.

Fax Legend:

1. sP=space
2. rP=red pixel
3. gP=green pixel
4. yP=yellow pixel
5. bP=blue pixel
6. wP=white pixel
7. EN=end line
More yet to be created.

These must all be in one line of text.
To implement another pixel after one, you can use a space, a "?" or a "!" (as long as it's one character).

All examples are perfect representations of fax files but please remove the quotes if actually implementing these.

Example 1 Of A Fax File:
"rP wP yP EN bP wP gP"

Example 2 Of A Fax File:
"rP?wP?yP?EN?bP?wP?gP"

Example 3 Of A Fax File:
"rP!wP!yP!EN!bP!wP!gP"

You can read the .fax file that comes with the library as an example.
Don't forget to read the Readme file.

*The library also reads ".txt" files, but I'd reccomend naming the file extension ".fax"
