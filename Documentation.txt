Code:

To use the library, please include:
#include "pixel.hpp"
#include "fax.hpp"

After that, call FaxRead("PATH/TO/FAX_FILE");
This will read and output the data from the ".fax" file*



Fax File*:

The Fax File is a file in which the data for what color of pixel, and where a pixel shall be is in.
The data in these files is inputted by you........ for now.

Fax Legend:

1. sP=space
2. dP=black pixel
3. rP=red pixel
4. gP=green pixel
5. yP=yellow pixel
6. bP=blue pixel
7. wP=white pixel
8. EN=end line
More yet to be created.

These must all be in one line of text.
To implement another pixel after one, you can use a space, a "?", a "!", etc (as long as it's one character).

All examples are perfect representations of fax files but please remove the quotes if actually implementing these.

Example 1 Of A Fax File:
"rP wP yP EN bP wP gP"

Example 2 Of A Fax File:
"rP?wP?yP?EN?bP?wP?gP"

Example 3 Of A Fax File:
"rP!wP!yP!EN!bP!wP!gP"

You can read the .fax file that comes with the library as an example.



To add another sprite, call "nextFax();". Then, call "readFax(PATH/TO/FAX_FILE);". This will draw another sprite after the previous call to draw a sprite.

Example Of Drawing Another Sprite:

faxRead("color.fax");
faxNext();
faxRead("apple.fax");



Don't forget to read the Readme file.
*The library also reads ".txt" files, but I'd reccomend naming the file extension ".fax"
